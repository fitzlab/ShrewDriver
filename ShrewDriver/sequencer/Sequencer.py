'''
This gives you different ways of ordering trials. 
You provide a set of trials and select the sequence type, and then call getNextTrial() over and over.
You need to tell getNextTrial() whether the current trial succeeded or not. 
Run this file to see an example.

Sequences:
    RANDOM - Each trial is chosen randomly from the set of possible trials. (sample with replacement)
    BLOCK - Each trial is presented once in random order. (sample without replacement)
    RANDOM_RETRY - Each trial is chosen randomly. If a trial is failed, keep retrying until success.
    BLOCK_RETRY - Each trial is presented once (random order). Unsuccessful trials are repeated until success.
    SEQUENTIAL - Each trial is presented once (in order).

Implementation:
This is vaguely a Strategy pattern.
The inheritance is really half-assed, but whatever, it works and it's reasonably organized.
