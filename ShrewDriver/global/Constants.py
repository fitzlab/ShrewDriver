Task types:
    TWOAFC - Two-alternative forced choice. 
    GNG - Go / No Go. 
    GNG_SPLUS - Go / No Go, but with an SPLUS following every correct rejection.
    NOSTIM - Task that doesn't use the screen, e.g. for acclimation to initiations or headfix.

Sequences:
    RANDOM - Each trial is chosen randomly from the set of possible trials. (sample with replacement)
    BLOCK - Each trial is presented once (random order). 
    RANDOM_RETRY - Each trial is chosen randomly. If a trial is failed, keep retrying until success.
    BLOCK_RETRY - Each trial is presented once (random order). Unsuccessful trials are repeated until success.
    SEQUENTIAL - Each trial is presented once (in order).
    INTERVAL - A set of hard trials, then a set of easy trials, and so on. Requires some setup, see SequencerInterval.py.
    INTERVAL_RETRY - A set of hard trials, then a set of easy trials, and so on. Requires setup. Unsuccessful trials are repeated until success.

Trial States:
    TIMEOUT - the black screen between trials. Longer timeout for failing, shorter for succeeding.
    INIT - Trial initiation phase. See "Trial Initiation Modes" below.
    DELAY - gray screen of variable duration preceding the first grating presentation
    GRAY - gray screen between gratings, constant duration
    SPLUS - grating that is precedes rewardPeriod
    SMINUS - grating that does not precede rewardPeriod
    REWARD - gray screen during which reward is available. Same duration as GRAY.

Trial Results:

    NO_RESPONSE - Shrew didn't lick
    ABORT - Shrew left IR beam during trial
    FALSE_ALARM - Lick following an SMINUS
