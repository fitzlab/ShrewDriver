Sequences:
    RANDOM - Each trial is chosen randomly from the set of possible trials. (sample with replacement)
    BLOCK - Each trial is presented once (random order). 
    RANDOM_RETRY - Each trial is chosen randomly. If a trial is failed, keep retrying until success.
    BLOCK_RETRY - Each trial is presented once (random order). Unsuccessful trials are repeated until success.

Trial States:
    TIMEOUT - the black screen between trials. Longer timeout for failing, shorter for succeeding.
    INIT - Trial initiation phase. See "Trial Initiation Modes" below.
    DELAY - gray screen of variable duration preceding the first grating presentation
    GRAY - gray screen between gratings, constant duration
    SPLUS - grating that is precedes rewardPeriod
    SMINUS - grating that does not precede rewardPeriod
    REWARD - gray screen during which reward is available. Same duration as GRAY.
